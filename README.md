# Mod Description
## Wave Spawning
The zombies in this mod are berzerkers. They will continue spawning every 2 minutes. To try and force a wave spawn you only need to fire the blaster. This will force a check to see if enough time has passed to spawn another wave.
## Gun changes
The Blaster: now works as a pistol 
 
The Shotgun: fires a slug, and therefore has no spread  

The Rocket Launcher: explosion does less splash damage, but will still kill  with a direct hit  

The Railgun: Works more like a sniper, shoots a bullet that does a lot of damage but needs cock it back  

machine gun: Less kick so its easier for longer ranges  

grenade launcher: Grenades shoot out 2x faster and have a slightly shorter timer  
### Pack a Punch Guns
In COD you can Pack a Punch guns to make them more powerful, since there are already better versions of guns they will be the Pack a Punched versions  
Also, end-game guns will be in this section, they get unlocked in the later waves

Super Shotgun: Shoots slugs like the regular shotgun, but does a lot more damage  
Chain Gun: Upgraded version of the machine gun  
Hyper Blaster: Shoots Blaster like normal, but they move as fast as bullets. Also, damage is increased.  
BFG: slow down the projectile and lower the radius to not be as overpowered

## Points System
Every time you damage a monster you will earn 10 points, and every time you kill a monster you will earn 100 points.  
Your points are shown in the HUD where the health used to be, another challenge of this mod is not knowing what your health currently is.  
Anothe way to see your points is on the in game help screen.  
The points will be used to unlock new guns and perks
## Getting new weapons
Every 500 points you earn will earn you a new gun and some ammo for your previous guns  
## Getting perks
Every 1000 points you earn will earn you a new perk that will make you stronger
